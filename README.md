# The purpose of this program is to schedule a list of operations using the Force Directed Scheduling (FDS) technique. The program should use FDS to create a High Level State Machine (HLSM) written in Verilog. The program should detect if statements within an input file and write proper output to handle that case

# 4. 
# Brendan Cassidy - Parsing input files, creating objects for manipulation, detect if/else statements error correction
# Diego Alantera - ASAP and ALAP scheduling, computing probabilities, and computing type distributions
# Evan Weiler - Computing Self, Predecessor, and Successor Forces and Scheduling of Nodes, error correction
# Logan Knott - writing to output file (HLSM, always blocks, case statements), testing
